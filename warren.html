                    <p>Warren is a slim man of average height with black, straight hair, which was initially styled in an undercut-like fashion, with most of it being kept quite short aside from a prominent wisp on the right part of his face. Warren has black eyes and a mildly prominent nose, with his most distinctive facial feature being his long, and thick lips. Seven years after the disappearance of Tenrou Island, the only difference in Warren's appearance seems to be his haircut, with his hair now being left free to partially cover his forehead, being styled in a single prominent spike on top of his head.
                    Warren initially donned a high-collared red jacket, with striped brown padding over the shoulders and neck areas, with part of it protruding downwards on the chest, following the zip closing the jacket. Each of its light-colored cuffs bore a line on the back edge, and the jacket was closed around Warren’s waist by a light belt with a round buckle, somehow shaped like a mechanical device, with a small, dark capsized pyramid on it. He also wore a pair of white pants tucked inside boots, with the parts covering his feet being black, and the ones coming down from his elbows being reminiscent of light, loose shin-guards made of cloth. After the time skip, Warren now wears a double-breasted sleeveless green tunic held closed on the chest by four buttons, with pale green sleeves emerging from under it, tucked inside long, similarly-colored gloves, and a light green sash circling his waist. He also wears light-colored pants, similarly tucked inside simple boots

                                        <p>Warren, although he may not look it, is classified as one of the more powerful Mages in the guild, and he has gone on a huge number of jobs alone. His fear of heights causes him many problems in his life. At one point he took a girl on a date, but as they were crossing a bridge, his mental shouts of "Help, save me!!! I'm scared!!!" were heard by everyone in town.</p>

                                <p>Telepathy (Terepashī): A Caster Magic that allows one to converse mind-to-mind. In battle, it's possible for Warren to read his opponent's mind, so he can predict their movements. His skill in this area can also be used to allow others to telepathically contact each other with him as a liaison; and if necessary, Warren can even conduct mass communication on a wide range of effect, as seen when he contacted the scattered members of Fairy Tail throughout Magnolia. However, Warren's telepathy sometimes backfires when he decides to use it while thinking inappropriate thoughts, not realizing he is failing to keep them to himself, or is confiding disturbing things to people who would rather not hear about them. It can also overload him if too many people try to talk through his telepathy at once, or someone brazenly screams in his ear while using him to send out a telepathic message.</p>

                            <li>n Fairy Tail Zerø: Chapter 10, Zera was the one who was supposed to lock the cage in which imprisoned Geoffery, but due to her being an illusion, it couldn't be locked, leading to the latter's escape.</li>
                            <li>Instead of the "Ø" gradually disappearing over the series, Hiro Mashima instead wanting to do a countdown of numbers leading to zero or a countdown of letters in the alphabet but eventually settled for the gradual loss of opaqueness.</li>
                            <li>Hiro Mashima wanted Mavis' initial character depiction to be someone who hated guilds, then coming to gradually love them. But due to the page limit, he had to drop this idea.</li>
                            <li>Hiro Mashima stated he really wanted fans to understand that Law and Fairy Law were completely different Magics, with the latter being a perfected version of the former.</li>
                            <li>Geoffrey's (Phantom Lord's future founder) surname was supposed to be mentioned in the story.</li>

                        <h2>Summary</h2>
                        <p>105 years before the events of Fairy Tail, six-year-old Mavis Vermillion lives on Sirius Island as a servant of the Red Lizard (赤い蜥蜴 レッドリザード Reddo Rizādo?) wizards' guild. A violent skirmish breaks out between Red Lizard and Blue Skull (青い髑髏 ブルースカル Burū Sukaru?), a rival guild, leaving Mavis the apparent sole survivor alongside Zera, the young daughter of Red Lizard's master. Seven years later, a band of treasure hunters—Yuri Dreyar, Precht Gaebolg, and Warrod Sequen—come to the island in search of its centerpiece, the Sirius Orb (天狼玉 Tenrōgyoku?). As Mavis and Yuri contend over ownership of the orb, they discover it has already been taken by Blue Skull. Mavis proposes she and Zera accompany the treasure hunters to recover the treasure.

                       The group journeys to the city of Magnolia, where Blue Skull has established a brutal regime. Mavis fails to bluff the guild's master into returning the orb with her illusory magic, and she retreats into the forest with her outmatched allies. There Mavis encounters a young man who, unbeknownst to her, is the infamous dark wizard Zeref. Mavis expresses sympathy for the youth, who is afflicted with a curse that withers and kills all life around him, and convinces him to teach her and her allies how to use magic to combat Blue Skull. They successfully overthrow Blue Skull using their magic, but Mavis discovers that the orb has become contaminated with evil magic. When Yuri takes the orb for himself, he unwillingly fuses with a massive skeletal dragon utilized by Blue Skull and mindlessly rampages through the city. Mavis exorcises the magic possessing Yuri by casting Law (ロウ Rō?), a prototype spell learned from Zeref. As a side effect of using the spell, however, Mavis becomes permanently ageless.

                       After recovering and learning of Mavis's condition, Yuri dedicates himself to protecting her as a friend. He also reveals to Mavis that Zera is an illusion only she can perceive; Zera further confirms that the real Zera died during Blue Skull's raid on the island, and that Mavis subconsciously created her to cope with her death. Mavis accepts Zera as an illusion, causing her to disappear, and organizes the Fairy Tail wizard guild in her memory.</p>

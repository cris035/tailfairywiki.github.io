                <p style="color: white">On Christmas Eve, much of the town of Magnolia are scurrying around, along with the help of the members from Fairy Tail, to complete the decorations for the incoming holiday. In the Kardia Cathedral hall, Lucy complains about the master and Cana's incessant drinking but Juvia calms her down and points to it's Christmas Eve. Above, Natsu, Gajeel, and Gray all are arguing while they are cleaning the tower's bell, while the Strauss siblings and Levy are giving out gift bags to all of the children. Erza commands everyone to do their fair share to which they all eventually accomplish, even as Lucy continues to complain. The continuous arguing of the guys, along with Happy's mischievous actions, leads to the church's bell being dislodged and breaking, angering the fellow members but with the quick teamwork of each other, the bell is eventually restored in a better fashion. Later that with the final touches being the lit Christmas tree. Erza, beginning to get excited for Christmas day, brings in the holiday with her fellow comrades at Lucy's apartment, something Lucy isn't comfortable with from onset.</p>

               <center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/portfolio/drunk.png" alt=""></center>
                <p style="color: white">As everyone makes their comments on the following events taking place at Lucy's reside, Erza tell the latter to calm down and to enjoy their youth, pouring her a glass to which everyone cheers and celebrates the holiday. Not long after, however, all of the girls become intoxicated to which both Natsu and Gray are frightened and Gajeel shocked at their behavior. Meanwhile, The Connell family enjoys Christmas dinner together as Asuka asks her parents if Santa will arrive, which they confirm he will. The former two try to escape, but Erza stops them and tells them to pour her another drink. Levy incessantly laughs, Lucy becomes flirty, Carla bossy, Wendy dizzy, and lastly Juvia teary-eyed. The girls then begin to flirt and converse with the guys during their drunkard status which angers Erza to which she elects everyone to participate in the Guild Master Game, which everyone picks a straw with a number and who everyone gets the crown straw will be able to give any order they desire.</p>

                <p style="color: white">Starting from Gajeel being stripped naked to Gray embarrassingly yelling his master's name to Lucy being tortured due to Erza's hot wax treatment, the antics become wild and far out from what the Mages were expecting. As they all get tired out from the orders and begin the next round, Gray catches a glance at Erza's numbered stick, following with him becoming the master due to him selecting the correct crowned stick. He smirks as he knows he cheated but it's only to payback Erza for all of the misfortune she delivered to everyone. He finally decides on his order: that Erza must strip naked and walk home, this shocking everyone. Not long after Gray convinces himself she will tremble before him, Erza goes through with the order and strips, something that scares everyone she's really performing the task while Gray tries to stop her but fails, leading her to angrily leave the party. In the falling snow nude and all, Erza runs into a traversing Jellal who notices her current attire and quickly covers her up with his coat. He asks if she drank too much, which she confirms she did and that she was jealous of her friends' flirty behavior with each other. Jellal smiles it off and eventually begins walking Erza home in the cold.</p>

                    <p>Laki is a slim young woman of average height with straight, pale lavender hair set in a bowl cut-like style, with her fringe covering the left part of her forehead, and the right side exposed. She has also been seen sporting longer hair in other instances, with two bangs framing her face and her forehead being covered by her fringe. She has brown eyes, and a large, dark-colored ribbon adorning the top of her head. She is always shown wearing a pair of simple glasses with oval lenses. After the 7-year time skip, the only noticeable changes in her appearance are the hair, whose style is reminiscent of her previous long cut, but wavier, with the bangs framing her face and going down to her shoulders being undulated, with a triangular tuft covering her forehead, and larger breasts. Her ribbon now marks the spot where Laki’s hair is tied in a long ponytail, reaching down to the middle of her back.
                    Laki’s first outfit was composed of a light-colored coat reaching down below her waist, with dark cuffs retaining the original color on their back edges, a dark cravat tie around the collar, tight-fitting dark pants tucked inside light-colored boots with dark soles, and light colored gloves. She also had a small, dark satchel adorned by a pair of small hearts hanging on her right hip, seemingly attached to her waist. As of the year X791, Laki sports a red mantle, held closed on the front by a ring, over a strapless, dark dress, with a revealing neckline and a series of light-colored squares adorning its lower part, which has a light belt circling it around Laki’s waist, with three bullet-like objects attached to it on the left side, and dark boots.

                    <h2><center>Personality</center></h2>
                                        <p>Laki likes glasses and wears them as well, and she has a strong dislike towards perverts. Laki also expresses herself in strange ways, for example, she refers to getting a haircut as "chopping hair," eating as "feeding your stomach," and sleeping as "whittling away the defenseless hours." She seems to have a slightly sadistic side, as she keeps a large amount of torture devices in her room in Fairy Hills.</p>

                                <p>Wood-Make (Uddo Meiku): A form of Molding Magic that allows Laki to create a variety of objects or weapons out of wood to be used offensively or defensively, such as cutting-weapons or limbs. She is also able to create multiple wooden weapons in an instant to attack a large amount of opponents as well as merge herself with wood for stealth purposes.</p>

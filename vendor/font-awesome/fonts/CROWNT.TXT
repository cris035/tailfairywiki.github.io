                          -----------------------
                  Released as shareware in September 1997.

     Crown Title is designed to be used with layered outlines and
     perhaps negative leading to produce title blocks. It contains two
     alphabets, but no numbers or accented letters. The only
     punctation marks included are the hyphen, en-dash and em-dash. I
     recommend setting it at no smaller than 72 points.

     To avoid loss of quality, please do not convert this font to other 
     formats without checking with me first. Crown Title is currently 
     available in PostScript and TrueType formats for both Macintosh and 
     Windows.

     If you have received the wrong version, please download the version 
     you need from:

     I am releasing this font as shareware and asking for a
     registration fee of $10 (Canadian dollars for Canadian users;
     U.S. dollars or the equivalent of US$10 in local currency for
     users outside Canada).

     Registered users will receive a receipt and notice of any new
     versions or fonts that I release. For Canadian users, the price
     includes GST and, in Quebec, QST.

     Crown Title may not be sold or modified without my written consent.
     Crown Title may not be distributed without the accompanying text
     file.

     Please send your registration fee in the form of a Canadian
     cheque or an international money order, with your name and return
